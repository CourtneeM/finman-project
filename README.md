# Finman Finance Tracker
A project from <a href="https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev/dont-just-learn-to-code-learn-to-create-ckdcgcf8g03d059s16345574k">3. Finman </a> \
I created the project based off of the screenshot provided, but also included additional features. Additional features include: Adding additional years, selecting which year / month to display, display an entire year of transaction amounts, and local storage. \
